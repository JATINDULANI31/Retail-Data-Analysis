## Description
- Loaded the retail sales data using pandas.
- Preprocessed the data to clean, transform, and prepare it for analysis.
- Visualized sales trends and patterns using various graph plots from matplotlib and seaborn.
- Predicted future sales using the following methods:
  - Linear Regression (LR)
  - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
  - Auto ARIMA
  - Seasonal ARIMA

## Visualization
Created various graphs to understand sales trends and patterns like:
- Line plots
- Bar charts
- Heatmaps
- Time series plots

## Future Sales Prediction
Predicted future sales using different statistical models:
- Linear Regression (LR) for basic trend estimation.
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting.
- Auto ARIMA for automated time series forecasting.
- Seasonal ARIMA for seasonal time series forecasting.

Compared the results and analyzed the accuracy of each prediction method.
